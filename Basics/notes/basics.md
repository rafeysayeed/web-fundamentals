html
css // scss, postcss

how much do I need to practice the basics to move ahead?
when I'm able to make anything I think in them
when I can convert what I see into fundamental structure and code
when making things in basics starts not feel challenging but boring and you wish to extend your capabilities
when you memorise most of the things by heart and the need to go through the cheatsheet is minimal
when I start self-correcting
when I can make all of the required components needed on all websites:
    - responsiveness
    - seo-friendly
    - accessibility
    - best-practices
